  "steps.whatIsRegex.description": "Regular Expressions are a string of characters that express a search pattern. Often abbreviated as `Regex` or `Regexp`. It is especially used to find or replace words in texts. In addition, we can test whether a text complies with the rules we set.\\n\\n For example, let's say you have a list of filenames. And you only want to find files with the `pdf` extension. Following typing an expression `^\\w+\\.pdf$` will work. The meaning of the definitions in this expression will become clearer as the steps progress.",

This differs from charset `[abc]`, charsets operate at the character level. Alternatives are at the expression level. For example, the following expression would select both `cat` and `rat`.

  "steps.flags.title": "修飾詞",

  "steps.flagsMultiline.description": "Regex sees all text as one line. But we use the `multiline` flag to handle each line separately.

  "steps.greedyMatching.description": "Regex does a greedy match by default. This means that the matchmaking will be as long as possible. Check out the example below. It refers to any match that ends in `r` and can be any character preceded by it. But it does not stop at the first letter `r`.",

  "steps.lazyMatching.title": "偷懶比對",
  "steps.lazyMatching.description": "Lazy matchmaking, unlike greedy matching, stops at the first matching. For example, in the example below, add a `?` after `*` to find the first match that ends with the letter `r` and is preceded by any character. It means that this match will stop at the first letter `r`.",
